Developed a webservice using Node.js, Express and using a java server. Item URL and Seller name were passed to backend which were used to crawl the item page and fetch the live price. </li>
                    <li>The third task was to write RESTful APIs in Node.js and MongoDB to support various functionalities being added to the website and android application.</li>
